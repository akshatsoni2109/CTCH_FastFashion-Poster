  Brand: Caterhood

Caterhood is a sustainable hoodie brand built on the philosophy of “Comfort with a Purpose.” The name reflects transformation—just like a caterpillar evolves into a butterfly, Caterhood seeks to bring positive change to the fashion industry. Every hoodie is made from eco-friendly materials, turning waste into wearable fashion. The brand’s identity is deeply rooted in sustainability, environmental awareness, and modern style.

The tagline, “Comfort with a Purpose,” emphasizes not just style and comfort but also the mission of making fashion responsible. By focusing on eco-conscious production, Caterhood offers a powerful alternative to fast fashion while inspiring people to make mindful clothing choices.

Poster Design

The Caterhood posters visually combine the themes of sustainability, transformation, and modern fashion.

Color Palette: Dominated by olive green (#009F52) and earthy brown (#3D401E), supported by accent shades of soft blues and warm yellow (#F4D03F). These colors symbolize growth, renewal, and optimism while staying true to an eco-conscious identity.

Typography: The posters primarily use Roboto (light, bold, italic) for modern minimalism, complemented by Designer and Script MT for artistic emphasis. This creates a professional yet stylish balance, highlighting important words like “Organic,” “Sustainable Thread,” and “Wear Your Style.”

Design Elements:

Poster 1 uses gradient backgrounds and plant vectors to symbolize growth.

Poster 2 blends typography with effects, emphasizing transformation and conscious fashion.

Poster 3 highlights collective eco-messages through word clusters and green symbols, reinforcing the campaign’s sustainable focus.

Overall, the posters communicate Caterhood’s eco-friendly mission while keeping a fashionable, modern aesthetic that appeals to young audiences.
